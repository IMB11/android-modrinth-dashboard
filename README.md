  + [ ] Push Notifications

## Development

If you wish to contribute to the UI stuff, all you need to do is:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run serve
```

If you wish to push a debug apk to your android device, you will need to run the following:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap run android
```

If you want to build an apk, you will need to open the `android` folder in Android Studio v2022+

## IOS Support

I cannot provide IOS support myself because I do not have any apple devices. However, you can add it yourself. Check the CapacitorJS documentation for information on adding IOS as a build target.
